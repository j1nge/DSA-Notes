## Steps To Solve 
1. Identify the problem:
	1. We need to write a program to find the position of a given number in a list of numbers arranged in decreasing order. Maximize the number of times we access elements from the list
2. ```cards```: A list of numbers sorted in decreasing order
	1. E.g. ```[13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1]
3. ```query``` : A number, whose position in the array is TBD
4. ```Position``` : The position of ```query``` in the list ```cards``` . E.g. ```3``` in the above case (counting from ```0```)

## ```Code```
```python
def locate_card(cards, query):
	pass
#Put "pass" as a placeholder when creating function

cards = [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0]
query = 7
output = 3
